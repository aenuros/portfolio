        <p>My name is Karen Burgos and I am a full stack
         web developer with 6 years of experience working
          with HTML and CSS, as well as learning other technologies.
         My focus is on making websites that are interesting to use
         from a user perspective, but never frustrating. I am a fast
        learner.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Wyncode Academy August 2018. I have a
        B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Florida.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I run a blog about linguistics for
        the general populace, called <a href="https://www.acelinguist.com">Ace Linguist</a>.
         I occasionally write about the intersection of language and programming.</p>
